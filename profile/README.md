# Welcome to DotContext

> **The "Save State" for Vibe Coding.**

**DotContext** is the open standard for defining, storing, and sharing context for AI-assisted software development. We provide the architecture to stop LLM "amnesia," eliminate hallucinations, and enforce engineering standards across your projects.

---

## The Problem

When coding with AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor), you constantly face:
1.  **Context Amnesia:** The AI forgets your tech stack or architectural rules after a few turns.
2.  **Repetition:** You paste the same "I use Python 3.12 with FastAPI" prompt every single time.
3.  **Hallucinations:** The AI suggests libraries you don't use or patterns you hate.

## The Solution: `/.context`

We standardized a directory structure that acts as the **Long-Term Memory** for your project. Whether generated by our CLI or created manually via template, the result is a semantic "brain" that any LLM can understand.

```text
.context/                 # [THE PRODUCT] The Magic Folder
├── config.toml           # [BRAIN] Metadata & Global Stack
├── .contextignore        # [FILTER] What the AI should NOT read
│
├── standards/            # [LAWS] Immutable Rules
│   ├── tech_stack.md     # Version details & allowed libs
│   ├── engineering.md    # Architecture (SOLID, Clean Arch)
│   └── style_guide.md    # Linter, Naming, Commit patterns
│
└── specs/                # [FOCUS] Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
    ├── active.md         # The Master Prompt for the current task
    └── backlog/          # Future features

```

## The Ecosystem

Our organization is divided into three core pillars:

### 1. [CLI](https://github.com/dotcontext/cli)

The automation tool. Generates the `.context` structure by detecting your project's stack or via an interactive wizard.

```bash
pip install dotcontext
dotcontext init

```

### 2. [Template](https://github.com/dotcontext/template)

The "Source of Truth." A clean, manual starter kit for developers who prefer `git clone` or copy-pasting the structure. Contains the canonical directory tree and file templates.

### 3. [Skills](https://github.com/dotcontext/skills)

The Knowledge Base. A collection of curated TOML files defining best practices for popular frameworks (FastAPI, Next.js, Django, Go). The CLI fetches data from here to populate your `standards/`.

---

## Philosophy: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

DotContext introduces **SDD for AI**:

> *"First, define the Spec in structured natural language. Then, let the AI implement."*

Instead of chatting aimlessly, you define the task in `specs/active.md`. This file becomes the "Master Prompt" that keeps the AI laser-focused on the immediate objective, while `standards/` ensures quality.

## Contributing

We are building the standard for the next generation of programming.

* **RFCs:** Open an issue in [dotcontext/cli](https://github.com/dotcontext/cli) to propose changes to the standard.
* **Skills:** Submit PRs to [dotcontext/skills](https://github.com/dotcontext/skills) to add best practices for your favorite framework.
